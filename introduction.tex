\smalltitle{Motivation}

Convex optimization can solve a broad variety of practical problems \textit{reliably} and \textit{quickly}. These problems include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Portfolio optimization
\item Device sizing (e.g. of electronic circuits)
\item Data fitting
\item Rocket landing
\item Optimal energy control in hybrid/electric road transport
\end{itemize}

Recently, there has been a rapid growth in \textit{embedded optimization}. In these applications, optimization must make \textit{real-time choices} and require \textit{little to now human intervention}. This requires proofs that an optimal solution will be found, and that it will be founded in bounded time. This is where convex optimization (and its subsets linear and least-squares optimizations) shine.
